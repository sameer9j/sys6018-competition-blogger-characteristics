# Original Instructions

### Setup
Designate a GitHub coordinator (someone who has not previously occupied this role). This person should create a private GitHub repository named "sys6018-competition-blogger-characteristics". Each teammate should be given access to commit to this repository.
Enter the competition here, join up with your teammates, and set your team name to your Collab group name for this assignment.
Read all of the competition instructions and post any questions you have about the competition to Piazza.
Think about the competition.
Who might care about it and why?
Why might it be a challenging problem to address?
What other problems resemble this problem?

### Models and Selection
At minimum, your team must implement a parametric linear model.
In addition to the linear model, we'll run an optional "open" track. In the open track, you may use any approach you know, along with any external data sources you think might be useful (synonym dictionaries, etc.).
You are required to implement a cross-validation approach of your choosing.
You are strictly prohibited from inspecting the content of the testing set with the goal of tuning your models to the testing set. Think about why this is a more serious concern in this challenge than in the previous challenge.

### Team and Logistics
Discuss and assign roles for each teammate and describe these roles clearly in a README file in the repository. The workloads should be fair and mutually agreed upon.
Submit at least 1 entry to Kaggle within 7 days of the assignment opening. This entry will not be graded, but it is required.
Finish your modeling approaches.

### Final Submission
Generate and submit your team's final entries to Kaggle prior to the competition deadline.
Commit and push all of the team's code to the GitHub repository prior to the Collab assignment deadline.
Enter the following information into the Collab submission window:

A link to the GitHub commit associated with your Kaggle competition entry. Please remember to make your repository public after the deadline so that it can be graded.

Your best score using a parametric linear model.

A 1-page reflection on the following questions.

Who might care about this problem and why?
What made this problem challenging?
What other problems resemble this problem?

### Grading
Everyone on your team will receive the same grade, which will be assessed on the basis of evidence found for the following key activities:

Data exploration
Data cleaning (sparsity reduction, missing value handling, etc.)
Rationale for the selected statistical modeling methods
Correct implementation and use of statistical modeling methods
Appropriate model selection approach (train/test, cross-validation, etc.)
Thoroughly documented code (R comments)
Appropriate use of functions to reduce code complexity and redundancy
Clear thinking about the reflection questions
The above activities can be evidenced entirely within your source code files and/or README. No external documents (e.g., Word, PDF, etc.) are required.

### Bonus Points
Bonus points will be awarded to the 5 top-ranked teams as follows:

If R <= 5:  Bonus = 10 * (1 / R) 

Otherwise:  Bonus = 0

where R is your team's rank within the class. The final ranking will only consider your parametric linear model. The "open" track will not count toward the bonus ranking.

### Notes
You have limited competition entries per day. Plan accordingly.
Your Kaggle submission timestamp and your GitHub commit timestamp must both be prior to the assignment due date in order to receive a non-zero score on this assignment.
